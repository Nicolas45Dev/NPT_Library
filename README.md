# NPT Librairy
> A small library for Openscad for NPT Pipe fitting.

This library gives you access to multiple NPT fitting for your gardening project or for decoration.
All the modules in the library are parametric. So, you can change the size to the one you need.

## Disclaimer ##

Whatever the type of plastic you are printing the pipe, those were not tested to pass any standard. They might break under high pressure or high temperature.
Use the pipe in a safe way.

## Installation

OS X

Add the file NPT Pipe.openscad to your library folder. It should be $HOME/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries

Linux

Add the file NPT Pipe.openscad to your library folder. It should be $HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries

Windows:

Add the file NPT Pipe.openscad to your library folder. It should be C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD\libraries or C:\Program Files(x86)\OpenSCAD\libraries

## Usage example

Open the file "NPT Demo" to see all the models. The file gives you all the information on how to use the modules.



## Limitation

The library has some limitations at the moment. All the modules enable you to render fitting with 5 different diameter form 3/8 to 1 1/4.
The 90-degree elbow works only if the first diameter is greater than the second one. Finally, the Y, 90 elbow and the T model are hard to compile. So, you must render those models in order to be able to visualize them. 
I will try to work on new models and change the design of some existing models.

This project was possible will the help of Dan Kirshner who write the code a module to generate nice thread with a lot of great features.
